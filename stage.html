                <h2>Knowing the stage of cancer is crucial.</h2>
                <p>Treatment teams must be aware of the prostate cancer's stage in order to plan, diagnose, and make well-informed healthcare decisions. It assists medical professionals in assessing the cancer's aggressiveness, extent, and propensity to spread, all of which have an impact on available treatments and the anticipated result.</p>
                <strong><p>Here's why it's critical to comprehend staging:</p></strong>
                <h3>Planning for Treatment</h3>
                <p>The suggested type and intensity of treatment is directly influenced by the cancer's stage. For instance, active surveillance may be used to treat malignancies in their early stages, whereas more aggressive treatments like hormone therapy, radiation, or surgery may be needed for cancers in their advanced stages. 
                </p>
                <h3>Prognosis</h3>
                <p>The patient's chances of survival and recovery are revealed by the stage. The survival rate of prostate cancer is significantly higher in its early stages than in its later stages. </p>
                <h3> Making Well-Informed Decisions</h3>
                <p>By using the stage information, patients can make more educated decisions about their care, talk with their doctor about treatment options, and gain a better understanding of their illness.</p>
                <h3>Observation and Follow-Up</h3>
                <p>Staging aids medical professionals in deciding the kind and frequency of follow-up examinations required to check for cancer spread or relapse.  </p>

                <h2>Stages of Prostate Cancer</h2>
                <p>In New Zealand, healcare organisations use TNM System which indicate: </p>
                    <li>Tumour: This is an indicator of tumour or involvement of a malignant tumour size</li>
                    <li>Node: This is an indicator of existance of cancer cells in lymph nodes </li>
                    <li>Metastasis: This is an indicator of spread of cancer to other parts of body</li>

            <div class="side-effect">
                <p>Treatment for prostate cancer can have some negative effects. The adverse effects of treatment usually go away a few weeks after the completion of treatment.</p>
            <p>The following side effects could occur, depending on your treatment:</p>
            <p><strong>Nerve damage: </strong>A bundle of nerves close to the bladder may be damaged during surgery which can cause problems with erections and bladder control.</p>
            <p><strong>Infertility: </strong>Because semen is no longer ejaculated during orgasm, infertility can result from surgery, cryotherapy, and radiation. You are unable to conceive biological offspring after experiencing what is known as a dry orgasm.</p>
            <p><strong>Bladder problems: </strong>Radiation treatment can irritate the lining of your bladder and urethra.
            You may notice:</p>
                    <li style="font-size: 0.95rem">Needing to pee more</li>
                    <li style="font-size: 0.95rem">A burning sensation when peeing</li>
                    <li style="font-size: 0.95rem"> Problems with the flow</li>
            <p>It is normal to lose some bladder control (incontinence) after the catheter has been removed or after radiation treatment. Regular pelvic floor exercises can help with recovery.</p>
            <p><strong>Bowl problems: </strong>Radiation treatment can irritate the lining of your bowel and rectum (proctitis).
            You may notice:</p>
                    <li style="font-size: 0.95rem">You pass more wind than usual</li>
                    <li style="font-size: 0.95rem">Your bowl motions may be looser and more urgent</li>
                    <li style="font-size: 0.95rem"> You may feel your bowls have not emptied properly</li>
            <p>Occasionally, you may experience pain and bleeding. With modern radiation techniques, bowel problems are much less common than they used to be.</p>
