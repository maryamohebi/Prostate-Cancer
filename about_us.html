                        <h2>About Us</h2>
                        <p>We are dedicated to increasing awareness, providing support, and promoting early detection of prostate cancer in Aotearoa New Zealand. Our mission is to support individuals, educate communities, and collaborate with healthcare providers.</p>
                    </section>

                    <section id="pillars">
                        <h2>Our four pillars of work</h2>
                        <p>Advocacy, education, research, and support are the four primary areas of focus for the Prostate Cancer Foundation NZ in order to realize its mission to "significantly reduce suffering and death from prostate cancer."
                        running a campaign.</p>
                        <h3>Advocacy</h3>
                        <p>PCFNZ is committed to representing all people with the illness and promoting their interests—as well as those of their families—before governmental, health, and medical organizations in order to improve the quality of care provided throughout Aotearoa New Zealand. On July 27, 2023, we formally sent the petition of Kristine Hayward to Parliament. A subsidized, risk-based, and equitable prostate cancer screening program must be established in New Zealand, according to Kristine's petition, which has gathered over 30,000 signatures.</p>
                        <h3>Education</h3>
                        <p>One of our greatest challenges is raising awareness of the disease and the importance of early detection. Prostate cancer can be cured if caught early, but many people won't exhibit any symptoms, and by the time they're checked out and diagnosed, their treatment options are restricted.</p>
                        <h3>Research</h3>
                        <p>The Prostate Cancer Foundation of NZ (PCFNZ) has a long history of supporting innovative research projects that seek to improve clinical outcomes, advance our knowledge of prostate or testicular cancer, direct the creation of superior support plans for those affected, and assist us in advocating for the elimination of deaths and suffering from prostate and testicular cancer in Aotearoa New Zealand.</p>
                        <h3>Support</h3>
                        <p>A prostate cancer diagnosis may be a confusing and stressful time for families and whanau, often leaving more questions than answers. The knowledge and experiences of our support network are tremendously helpful to many people.</p>

                    <p>Particularly in its early stages, prostate cancer frequently exhibits no symptoms and may go undiagnosed for a while. Other prostate disorders (not prostate cancer) or other medical conditions may be the cause of symptoms like trouble urinating, a sudden or frequent urge to urinate, lower back or hip pain, or blood in the urine or semen. See your doctor if you encounter any of the symptoms listed below (hyperlink to prostate cancer page), and read more about them here.</p>

                <div class="accordion-content">
                    <p>The disease is twice as common in men who have a first-degree male relative. The risk rises if you have two or more first-degree relatives who were diagnosed before the age of 65. Additionally, those who have male ancestors who were diagnosed at an early age and those who are known to carry the BRAC2 gene are at a higher risk.</p>

                <div class="accordion-content">
                    <p>Although there is no known way to prevent prostate cancer, research indicates that lifestyle and environmental variables may raise the risk. Eating a balanced diet, staying physically active, and maintaining a healthy weight will all enhance overall wellbeing and reduce the chance of health issues. </p>

                    <p>Compared to other men, Māori men die from prostate cancer at a higher rate, while their incidence is marginally lower. A subsequent diagnosis or the available treatment options could be the cause of this.</p>

                    <p>Men should be prepared to take the initiative and ask for testing if they want to get tested for prostate cancer because not all general practitioners are aggressive in encouraging this procedure. You should be able to get the PSA test if you are over 50 (or younger with a family history of the disease), but if you continue to have resistance, we advise you to contact another general practitioner.</p>
